- Static (only one value)
- Random
- V-shaped

For third and fourth part of project:

Program compare execution time for QuickSort algorithm in recurrent and iterative version for 3 setting of pivot on 2 types of array

Algorithms list:
- QuickSort (recurrent)
- QuickSort (iterative)

Pivot settings:
- extreme right
- Middle
- Random

Array types:
